**IMPORTANT:** Some laptop and desktop browsers get incorrectly marked as mobile. You may need to lower your page zoom to see proper desktop styling. This is a known issue (#[[https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues/455|455]]) of the current build of Quartz v4. ^76f73a
# Foreword
Welcome to my blog. I occasionally muse on my coding projects here.
I don't have much to say about myself, but you can [[blog/Contact|contact]] me using the links on that page.
You will probably notice that the blog's locale is set to `ja_JP`. This is just something you have to deal with - I despise American date formatting, and Imperial units.

# Index 
Here is an index of articles by release date:

| **Date**     | **Title**                                                                 | **Description**                                           | **Tags** |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `2024-05-08` | [[How I built a C preprocessor, how you can too, and why you shouldn't.]] | *I build a C preprocessor and somehow succeed.*           | #succ    |
| `2024-05-06` | [[Hosting a Subfolder of an Obsidian Vault on Quartz]]                    | *I go on a journey while putting this blogsite together.* | #meta    |

I update this index manually, so if articles are missing etc, let me know.
The **Title** field should link to the article, and clicking on any of an article's **Tags** should show you a list of all pages with that tag (including this one)
